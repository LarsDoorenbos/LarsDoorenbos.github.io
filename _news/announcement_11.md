Our work on <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18175'>predicting galaxy spectra from photometry</a> was accepted as an oral at the International Conference on Machine Learning for Astrophysics. I will also give a flash talk on <a href='https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2022/10/aa43900-22/aa43900-22.html'>ULISSE</a>.
